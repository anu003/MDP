Assignment 4: 
	Reinforcement Learning - Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Submitted Files List:
 - xhu87_analysis.pdf
 - README.txt
 - MazeGame.java
 - MazeBahavior.java

The algorithms are provided by BURLAP 2 library:
http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/

You can import the two java classes into IDE such as Eclipse.
1) MazeGame.java: this class holds the model and you can create all 
   kinds of maze games with it. It already has two default MDPs: 7x7 and 25x25.
2) MazeBahavior.java: this class implements the algorithms. The parameters such as 
   gamma, DELTA, and MAX_ITERATIONS are in the beginning of the file and you can
   change them easily.
